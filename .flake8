# You can ignore specific error codes if necessary. Use sparingly.
# Example: ignore = E203, W503
# E203: whitespace before ':' (often conflicts with Black formatter if not using it)
# W503: line break before binary operator (PEP 8 changed its mind; Black prefers after)
# It's generally better to fix warnings or use a formatter like Black.

# To enable specific checks or plugins (e.g., flake8-bugbear for finding likely bugs).
# By default, Flake8 runs enabled checks from pycodestyle and PyFlakes.
# select = E,F,W,C90 # Default checks
# select = E,F,W,C90,B,B9 # Example with flake8-bugbear (B, B9)
